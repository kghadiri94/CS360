# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app was looking to capture a weight tracking device that had a login page, a data page that captured the users daily weight and graphed their progress, and a settings page that allowed the user to enable or disbale notifications.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There was a login page, a data page, and settings page. The login page captured their login and also allowed them to create an account, the data page captured their daily weight and graphed it along with their other weight entries, the settings page allowed them to change notifications or log out.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
Since this was my first mobile app, I was very careful and limited in knowledge. In future mobile apps, I will use what I now know and create my in depth UI and settings.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Android studio allows an emulator of a phone to be launched, with this you can access your app and test it.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The login page was a lot more dificult to integrate than I orginally thought. I used google services to help with this.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The login page I would say captured it pretty well as I overcame an obsatacle.
